##<a id="section1"></a> Introduction

The Context Adapter is a FIWARE component part of the [FIWARE platform](https://www.fiware.org).

For the time being, the Context Adapter is able to function in 2 compatible modes. This is, the component is able to
handle requests for each one of these modes simultaneously.

The supported modes are:

    1 Black Button flow

    2 Geolocation resolution and update

###<a id="section11"></a> Black Button flow

Working in this mode, the Context Adapter is in charge of adapting the communication (protocols and messages) between
Telef√≥nica's IoT Platform (and, more concretely, the [Orion Context Broker](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion))
and the services exposed by Third Parties.

To this regard, the Context Adapter is able to handle redirected `updateContext` requests (see the `Context Adapter as a
context provider scenario` section below) or notification (`notify`) requests (see the `Context Adapter notifications
scenario`) sent by the Context Broker.

The main capability of the Context Adapter consists of transforming these requests into requests to the corresponding
Third Party service associated to the clicked Black Button.

Once the response is received from the Third Party (synchronously or asynchronously), the Context Adapter
updates the concrete Black Button entity updating not only the response or result received from the Third Party service
but also the status of the Black Button request.

####<a id="section111"></a> Context Adapter as context provider scenario

In this scenario, the Context Broker is properly configured to redirect `updateContext` requests to the Context Adapter
as the result of a Black Button click.

To configure the Context Adapter to work as a context provider, the `CA_MODE` configuration variable must be set to
`context-provider` as mentioned in the [Running the Context Adapter](#section4) section below.

In this scenario, the Context Broker redirects to the Context Adapter an `updateContext` request such as the following one:

<pre>
    {
        "contextElements": [
            {
                "id": &lt;device-id&gt;,
                "type": "BlackButton",
                "isPattern": false,
                "attributes": [
                    {
                        "name": "aux_interaction_type",
                        "type": "string",
                        "value": &lt;synchronous | asynchronous&gt;
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "aux_service_id",
                        "type": "string",
                        "value": &lt;aux-service-id&gt;
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "aux_op_action",
                        "type": "string",
                        "value": &lt;aux-op-action&gt;
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "aux_op_extra",
                        "type": "string",
                        "value": &lt;aux-op-extra&gt;
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "aux_op_status",
                        "type": "string",
                        "value": &lt;aux-op-status&gt;
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "updateAction": "UPDATE"
    }
</pre>

From the information contained in this request (and more concretely the `aux_service_id` property), the Context Adapter obtains
detailed information about the Third Party service to be invoked sending a `queryContext` request to the
Context Broker with the following payload:

<pre>
    {
      "entities": [
        {
          "id": &lt;service-id&gt;,
          "type": "service",
          "isPattern": false,
          "attributes": [
            "endpoint",
            "method",
            "authentication",
            "mapping",
            "timeout"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
</pre>

The Context Broker responds to the previous `queryContext` request with information about the concrete Third Party service such as the following one:

<pre>
    {
      "contextElements": [
        {
          "id": &lt;service-id&gt;,
          "type": "service",
          "isPattern": false,
          "attributes": [
            {
              "name": "endpoint",
              "type": "string",
              "value": &lt;endpoint&gt;
            },
            {
              "name": "method",
              "type": "string",
              "value": &lt;method&gt;
            },
            {
              "name": "authentication",
              "type": "string",
              "value": &lt;authentication&gt;
            },
            {
              "name": "mapping",
              "type": "string",
              "value": &lt;mapping&gt;
            },
            {
              "name": "timeout",
              "type": "string",
              "value": &lt;timeout&gt;
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "statusCode": {
        "code": "200",
        "reasonPhrase": "OK"
      }
    }
</pre>

Using this information, the Context Adapter sends a request to the provided `endpoint` using the provided `method`
following the protocol specified in the [Third Party service protocol](#section113) section below.

The response or result received from the Third Party service is finally updated in the Context Broker
(via an `updateContext` request) as the result of the initial Black Button request as well as its final status
(i.e., successfully completed or completed with error).

####<a id="section112"></a> Context Adapter notification scenario

In this scenario, the Context Broker is properly configured to send notification requests to the Context Adapter as
the result of a Black Button click.

To configure the Context Adapter to work as a context provider, the `CA_MODE` configuration variable must be set to
`notification` as mentioned in the [Running the Context Adapter](#section4) section below.

In this scenario, the Context Broker sends notification requests to the Context Adapter such as the following one:

<pre>
    {
        "subscriptionId": &lt;subscription-id&gt;,
        "originator": &lt;orion-contextBroker-instance&gt;,
        "contextResponses": [
            {
                "contextElement": {
                    "id": &lt;device-id&gt;,
                    "type": "BlackButton",
                    "isPattern": false,
                    "attributes": [
                        {
                            "name": "interaction_type",
                            "type": "string",
                            "value": &lt;synchronous | asynchronous&gt;
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "service_id",
                            "type": "string",
                            "value": &lt;service-id&gt;
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "op_action",
                            "type": "string",
                            "value": &lt;op-action&gt;
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "op_extra",
                            "type": "string",
                            "value": &lt;op-extra&gt;
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "statusCode": {
                    "code": "200",
                    "reasonPhrase": "OK"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
</pre>

From the information contained in this request (and more concretely the `service_id` property), the Context Adapter obtains
detailed information about the Third Party service to be invoked sending a `queryContext` request to the
Context Broker with the following payload:

<pre>
    {
        "entities": [
            {
                "id": &lt;service-id&gt;,
                "type": "service",
                "isPattern": false,
                "attributes": [
                    "endpoint",
                    "method",
                    "authentication",
                    "mapping",
                    "timeout"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
</pre>

The Context Broker responds to the previous `queryContext` request with information about the Third Party service
such as the following one:

<pre>
    {
        "contextElements": [
            {
                "id": &lt;service-id&gt;,
                "type": "service",
                "isPattern": false,
                "attributes": [
                    {
                        "name": "endpoint",
                        "type": "string",
                        "value": &lt;endpoint&gt;
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "method",
                        "type": "string",
                        "value": &lt;method&gt;
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "authentication",
                        "type": "string",
                        "value": &lt;authentication&gt;
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "mapping",
                        "type": "string",
                        "value": &lt;mapping&gt;
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "timeout",
                        "type": "string",
                        "value": &lt;timeout&gt;
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "statusCode": {
            "code": "200",
            "reasonPhrase": "OK"
        }
    }
</pre>

Using this information, the Context Adapter sends a request to the provided `endpoint` using the provided `method`
following the protocol specified in the [Third Party service protocol](#section113) section below.

The response or result received from the Third Party service is finally updated in the Context Broker
(via an `updateContext` request) as the result of the initial Black Button request as well as its final status
(i.e., successfully completed or completed with error).

####<a id="section113"></a> Third Party service protocol

Once the information about the Third Party service has been collected, the Context Adapter interacts with it following
to the next protocol:

1 Synchronous Third Party services (for services with `interaction-type` to `synchronous`):

    1 The Context Adapter sends a request to the proper `endpoint` using the proper `method` with the following payload:
      {
        "button‚Äù: ‚Äù<button-id>",
        "action‚Äù: ‚Äù<action>‚Äù,
        "extra‚Äù: ‚Äù<extra>‚Äù
      }
    2 The Third Party service synchronously responds with a 200 - OK (the Context Adapter is able to deal with error
     codes such as not responding Third Party services, 4XX, 5XX, etc.) with the following payload:
      {
        "details‚Äù: {
            "rt":"20‚Äù,
            "rrgb":‚Äù00FF00"
        }
      }
      `details` may contain any JSON object which the Context Adapter will stringify and update in the Context Broker as
      the result of the original request.

2 Asynchronous Third Party services (for services with `interaction-type` to `asynchronous`):

    1 The Context Adapter sends a request to the proper `endpoint` using the proper `method` with the following payload:
          {
            "button‚Äù: ‚Äù<button-id>",
            "action‚Äù: ‚Äù<action>‚Äù,
            "extra‚Äù: ‚Äù<extra>‚Äù,
            "callback‚Äù: "http://context-adapter-host:port/v1/update‚Äù (the /v1 path and the /update part are both configurable)
          }
    2 The Third Party service synchronously responds to the previous request with a 200 - OK (the Context Adapter is
    able to deal with error codes such as not responding Third Party services, 4XX, 5XX, etc.).
    3 The Third Party service sends a `POST` request to the URL specified in the `callback` property sent in the
    original request with the following payload:
        {
            "buttonId‚Äù: ‚Äù<button-id>‚Äù,
            "externalId‚Äù: ‚Äù<external-id>‚Äù,
            "details‚Äù: {
                "rt":"20‚Äù,
                "rrgb":‚Äù00FF00"
        }
    `details` may contain any JSON object which the Context Adapter will stringify and update in the Context Broker as
    the result of the original request.
    4 The Context Adapter responds to the previous request from the Third Party service with a 200 - OK status code.

###<a id="section12"></a> Geolocation update

Working in this mode, the Context Adapter is able to update the geolocation of entities, transforming cell tower information
such as the cell identifier, the mobile country code, the mobile network code and the location area code into coordinates
(latitude and longitude).

In this case, the Context Adapter receives a notification of an entity update including a `P1` compound attribute
including all the cell tower information such as the following one:

<pre>
    {
        "subscriptionId": &lt;subscription-id&gt;,
        "originator": &lt;orion.contextBroker.instance&gt;,
        "contextResponses": [
            {
                "contextElement": {
                    "attributes": [
                        {
                            "name": "P1",
                            "type": "compound",
                            "value": [
                                {
                                    "name": "mcc",
                                    "type": "string",
                                    "value": &lt;mobile-country-code&gt;
                                },
                                {
                                  "name": "mnc",
                                  "type": "string",
                                  "value": &lt;mobile-network-code&gt;
                                },
                                {
                                  "name": "lac",
                                  "type": "string",
                                  "value": &lt;location-area-code-as-hexadecimal-number&gt;
                                },
                                {
                                  "name": "cell-id",
                                  "type": "string",
                                  "value": &lt;cell-id-as-hexadecimal-number&gt;
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ],
                    "type": &lt;type&gt;,
                    "isPattern": false,
                    "id": &lt;device-id&gt;
                },
                "statusCode": {
                    "code": "200",
                    "reasonPhrase": "OK"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
</pre>

Using the provided information, the Context Adapter invokes the
[Google Maps Geolocation API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/intro) to get the concrete
geolocation coordinates (latitude and longitude).

Once these coordinates have been received, the Context Adapter updates the geolocation of the concrete entity sending
`updateContext` request to the configured Context Broker with a payload similar to the following one:

<pre>
    {
        "contextElements": [
            {
                "id": &lt;device-id&gt;,
                "type": &lt;type&gt;,
                "isPattern": false,
                "attributes": [
                    {

##<a id="section2"></a> Dependencies
The Context Adapter component is a Node.js application which depends on certain Node.js modules as stated in the ```project.json``` file.

[Top](#section0)

##<a id="section3"></a> Installation
The Context Adapter can be installed in two ways: using the RPM or cloning the Github repository.

### Cloning the Github Repository
1. Clone the repository:
<pre> git clone https://github.com/telefonicaid/context-adapter.git </pre>
2. Get into the directory where the Context Adapter repository has been cloned:
<pre> cd context-adapter/ </pre>
3. Install the Node.js modules and dependencies:
<pre> npm install </pre>
The Context Adapter component server is ready to be started.

### Using the RPM
The project contains a script for generating an RPM that can be installed in Red Hat 6.5 compatible Linux distributions. The
RPM depends on Node.js 0.10 version, so EPEL repositories are advisable. 

In order to create the RPM, execute the following script, inside the `/rpm` folder:
```
create-rpm.sh -v <versionNumber> -r <releaseNumber>
```


Once the RPM is generated, it can be installed using the following command:
```
yum localinstall --nogpg <nameOfTheRPM>.rpm
```

##<a id="section4"></a>Running the Context Adapter
1. To run the Context Adapter component, just execute:
<pre> npm start </pre>

The Context Adapter component provides the user with 2 mechanisms to configure the component to the concrete needs of the user:

* Environment variables, which can be set assigning values to them or using the `context-adapter_default.conf` file if a packaged
version of the Context Adapter component is used.
* The [`config.js`](https://github.com/telefonicaid/context-adapter/blob/develop/config.js) located at the root of the Context Adapter component code, a JSON formatted file including the configuration properties.

It is important to note that environment variables, if set, take precedence over the properties defined in the `config.js` file.

The script accepts the following parameters as environment variables:

- CA_HOST: The host where the Context Adapter server will be started. Optional. Default value: "localhost".
- CA_PUBLIC_HOST: The public host or IP where the Context Adapter server will be listening. Default value: "127.0.0.1".
- CA_PORT: The port where the Context Adapter server will be listening. Optional. Default value: "9999".
- CA_PATH: The path to add to the routes where the Context Broker is attending requests. Optional. Default value: "/v1".
- CA_MODE: The Context Adapter supports 2 modes of operation: 1) it can act as a context provider receiving the redirected
updateContext requests received by the Context Broker as a consequence of button clicks (to set this
operation mode set the `mode` configuration option to "context-provider") and 2) being notified by the
Context Broker of new button clicks (to set this operation mode set the `mode` configuration option to
"notification"). Default value: "notification".
- LOGOPS_LEVEL: The logging level of the messages. Messages with a level equal or superior to this will be logged.
Accepted values are: "debug", "info", "warn" and "error". Optional. Default value: "info".
- PROOF_OF_LIFE_INTERVAL: The time in seconds between proof of life logging messages informing that the server is up and running normally. Default value: "60".
- DEFAULT_SERVICE: The service to be used if not sent by the Orion Context Broker in the requests. Optional. Default value: "blackbutton".
- DEFAULT_SERVICE_PATH: The service path to be used if not sent by the Orion Context Broker in the requests. Optional. Default value: "/".
- CB_HOST: The host where the Orion Context Broker is running. Optional. Default value: "localhost".
- CB_PORT: The port where the Orion Context Broker is listening. Optional. Default value: "1026".
- CB_PATH: The path to add to the routes where the Orion Context Broker is attending requests. Optional. Default value: "/v1".

For example, to start the Context Adapter and make it listen on port 7777, use:

As already mentioned, all this configuration parameters can also be adjusted using the
[`config.js`](https://github.com/telefonicaid/context-adapter/blob/develop/config.js) file whose contents are self-explanatory.

It is important to note that the Context Adapter component uses the `logops` module. For more information about how to further
configure it, please visit [https://www.npmjs.com/package/logops](https://www.npmjs.com/package/logops).

##<a id="section5"></a> Test coverage
The Context Adapter component source code includes a set of tests to validate the correct functioning of the whole set of capabilities
exposed by the component. This set includes:

- Attending synchronous operation requests
- Attending asynchronous operation requests
- Attending third party's service updates

### Running the tests
1. To run the tests, just execute:
<pre> make test </pre>

Take into consideration that the tests can be run using distint configurations using environment variables or properly
setting the [`config.js`](https://github.com/telefonicaid/context-adapter/blob/develop/config.js) file.

##<a id="section6"></a>How to contribute

Would you like to contribute to the project? This is how you can do it:

1. Fork this repository clicking on the "Fork" button on the upper-right area of the page.
2. Clone your just forked repository:
<pre>git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/context-adapter.git</pre>
3. Add the main Context Adapter repository as a remote to your forked repository (use any name for your remote repository, it does not have to be `context-adapter`, although we will use it in the next steps):
<pre>git remote add context-adapter https://github.com/telefonicaid/context-adapter.git</pre>
4. Synchronize the ```develop``` branch in your forked repository with the ```develop``` branch in the main Context Adapter repository:
<br/><br/>(step 4.1, just in case you were not in the ```develop``` branch yet) <pre>git checkout develop</pre>
(step 4.2)<pre>git fetch context-adapter</pre>
(step 4.3)<pre>git rebase context-adapter/develop</pre>
5. Create a new local branch for your new code (currently we use the prefixes: ```feature/``` for new features, ```task/``` for maintenance and documentation issues and ```bug/``` for bugs):
<pre>git checkout -b feature/some-new-feature</pre>
6. Include your changes and create the corresponding commits.
7. To assure that your code will land nicely, repeat steps 4.2 and 4.3 from your ```feature/some-new-feature``` branch to synchronize it with the latest code which may have landed in the ```develop``` branch of the main context-adapter repository during your implementation.
8. Push your code to your forked repository hosted in Github:
<pre>git push origin feature/some-new-feature</pre>
9. Launch a new pull request from your forked repository to the ```develop``` branch of the main Context Adapter repository. You may find some active pull requests available at <a href="https://github.com/telefonicaid/context-adapter/pulls" target="_blank">https://github.com/telefonicaid/context-adapter/pulls</a>.
10. Assign the pull request to any of the main Context Adapter developers (currently, [@gtorodelvalle](https://github.com/gtorodelvalle) or [@dmoranj](https://github.com/dmoranj)) for review.
11. After the review process is successfully completed, your code will land into the ```develop``` branch of the main Context Adapter repository. Congratulations!!!

For additional contributions, just repeat these steps from step 4 on.

##<a id="section7"></a>Additional development documentation
### Project build
The project is managed using Grunt Task Runner.

For a list of available task, type
```bash
grunt --help
```

The following sections show the available options in detail.


### Testing
[Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) Test Runner + [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) Assertion Library + [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) Spies, stubs.

The test environment is preconfigured to run [BDD](http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/) testing style with
`chai.expect` and `chai.should()` available globally while executing tests, as well as the [Sinon-Chai](http://chaijs.com/plugins/sinon-chai) plugin.

Module mocking during testing can be done with [proxyquire](https://github.com/thlorenz/proxyquire)

To run tests, type
```bash
grunt test
```

Tests reports can be used together with Jenkins to monitor project quality metrics by means of TAP or XUnit plugins.
To generate TAP report in `report/test/unit_tests.tap`, type
```bash
grunt test-report
```


### Coding guidelines
jshint, gjslint

Uses provided .jshintrc and .gjslintrc flag files. The latter requires Python and its use can be disabled
while creating the project skeleton with grunt-init.
To check source code style, type
```bash
grunt lint
```

Checkstyle reports can be used together with Jenkins to monitor project quality metrics by means of Checkstyle
and Violations plugins.
To generate Checkstyle and JSLint reports under `report/lint/`, type
```bash
grunt lint-report
```


### Continuous testing

Support for continuous testing by modifying a src file or a test.
For continuous testing, type
```bash
grunt watch
```


### Source Code documentation
dox-foundation

Generates HTML documentation under `site/doc/`. It can be used together with jenkins by means of DocLinks plugin.
For compiling source code documentation, type
```bash
grunt doc
```


### Code Coverage
Istanbul

Analizes the code coverage of your tests.

To generate an HTML coverage report under `site/coverage/` and to print out a summary, type
```bash
# Use git-bash on Windows
grunt coverage
```

To generate a Cobertura report in `report/coverage/cobertura-coverage.xml` that can be used together with Jenkins to
monitor project quality metrics by means of Cobertura plugin, type
```bash
# Use git-bash on Windows
grunt coverage-report
```


### Code complexity
Plato

Analizes code complexity using Plato and stores the report under `site/report/`. It can be used together with jenkins
by means of DocLinks plugin.
For complexity report, type
```bash
grunt complexity
```

### PLC

Update the contributors for the project
```bash
grunt contributors
```


### Development environment

Initialize your environment with git hooks.
```bash
grunt init-dev-env 
```

We strongly suggest you to make an automatic execution of this task for every developer simply by adding the following
lines to your `package.json`
```
{
  "scripts": {
     "postinstall": "grunt init-dev-env"
  }
}
``` 


### Site generation

There is a grunt task to generate the GitHub pages of the project, publishing also coverage, complexity and JSDocs pages.
In order to initialize the GitHub pages, use:

```bash
grunt init-pages
```

This will also create a site folder under the root of your repository. This site folder is detached from your repository's
history, and associated to the gh-pages branch, created for publishing. This initialization action should be done only
once in the project history. Once the site has been initialized, publish with the following command:

```bash
grunt site
```

This command will only work after the developer has executed init-dev-env (that's the goal that will create the detached site).

This command will also launch the coverage, doc and complexity task (see in the above sections).
